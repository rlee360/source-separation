# First
As someone whose first introduction to programming was a Hello World script on a [BASIC Stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Stamp) circa 2009, I always feel the urge to write some form of Hello World on every new platform or language I pick up, almost as a good luck ritual. Something about knowing that my program can greet me makes me feel a little better -- almost as if I have the grace of the gods to proceed on my perilous journey.

As to the phrase "Hello, World!" itself: in its original form, the clause was all lowercase, no exclamation point, with the two words separated by a single comma and space. The importance of this comma is [sometimes contested](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/74985/should-the-beginners-program-read-hello-world), and these days many programmers opt to exclude it. The use of the phrase "Hello, World!" was popularized by the widely renowned book _The C Programming Language_:
>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages:  
>
>Print the words  
>`hello, world`
>
>This is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. **With these mechanical details mastered, everything else is comparatively easy.**

# Second

I'm not quite sure how accurate that last statement is. I don't exactly consider the book light reading for someone who has never coded before. However, after learning C once and then coming back to this book, I can see why it is **the** reference on C.

As for the sub-title text, that's a humorous reference to the [Unix Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), which is essentially when time began for Unix computers. Unix Epoch time is recorded as seconds since 12:00 AM January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1970. Since that time is in UTC, the equivalent time in the US would be December 31<sup>st</sup>, 1969 7:00 PM, which, if a programmer [misinterprets time strings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34891782/what-could-cause-a-mysql-time-stamp-to-equal-december-31-1969), will likely cause this date to rear its end. Epic problems caused by Epoch problems.
